# Anomaly Network Traffic Detection

## Introduction/Background:
Due to nowadays' ever-growing network security concerns, an accurate and efficient way to distinguish normal activity flows from cyber attacks becomes exceedingly important. Our project will develop a trained machine in place of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to monitor network traffic for suspicious activities. To decrease false alarms in IDS, we plan to investigate and contrast the influences of more than 80 features branched under some of the most common types of attacks â€“ web-based, brute force, DoS (disk operating system), DDoS (distributed denial of service), infiltration, heart-bleed, bots, and portscan. Such a model would strengthen available defense tools against those sophisticated network attacks and alleviate burdens of website owners and administrators.

## Problem Definition:
We aim to build an IDS model to distinguish benign and potential anomaly network traffic. The goal is to minimize false positives while not permitting false negatives, or the most serious states of identifying malicious activity as acceptable.
