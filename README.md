Due to nowadays' ever-growing network security concerns, an accurate and efficient way to distinguish normal activity flows from cyber attacks becomes exceedingly important. Our project will develop a trained machine in place of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to monitor network traffic for suspicious activities. To decrease false alarms in IDS, we plan to investigate and contrast the influences of more than 80 features branched under some of the most common types of attacks – web-based, brute force, DoS (disk operating system), DDoS (distributed denial of service), infiltration, heart-bleed, bots, and portscan. Such a model would strengthen available defense tools against those sophisticated network attacks and alleviate burdens of website owners and administrators.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/wshi991201/wshi991201.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
